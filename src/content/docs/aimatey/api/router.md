Complete API reference for the `Router` class - intelligent routing across multiple backend providers.

:::note[Router is a backend, not a bridge]
`Router` implements `BackendAdapter`. It has no frontend adapter and no
`chat()` / `chatStream()` methods - it speaks IR through `execute()` and
`executeStream()`. Give it to a `Bridge` as the backend and call the bridge:

```typescript
const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'round-robin' });
router.register('openai', openaiBackend).register('anthropic', anthropicBackend);

const bridge = new Bridge(new OpenAIFrontendAdapter(), router);
const response = await bridge.chat({ model: 'gpt-4', messages: [...] });
```

Middleware belongs to the bridge as well (`bridge.use()`); `Router` has no
`use()` method, and neither `RouterConfig` nor `BridgeConfig` has a `middleware`
field.
:::

## Constructor

### `new Router(config?)`

Creates a new Router. Backends are **not** passed to the constructor - register
them afterwards with [`register()`](#registername-adapter).

**Parameters:**

- `config?: Partial<RouterConfig>` - Router configuration (see [`RouterConfig`](#routerconfig))

**Returns:** `Router` instance

**Example:**

```typescript
import { Bridge, Router } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-core';
import { OpenAIFrontendAdapter } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-frontend/openai';
import { AnthropicBackendAdapter } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-backend/anthropic';
import { OpenAIBackendAdapter } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-backend/openai';

const router = new Router({
  routingStrategy: 'round-robin',
  fallbackStrategy: 'sequential',
});

router
  .register('anthropic', new AnthropicBackendAdapter({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY! }))
  .register('openai', new OpenAIBackendAdapter({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY! }));

const bridge = new Bridge(new OpenAIFrontendAdapter(), router);
```

There is also a factory function, `createRouter(config?)`, with the same
signature.

---

## Methods

### `execute(request, signal?)`

Execute an IR request with automatic backend selection and fallback. This is the
`BackendAdapter` entry point - normally you call `bridge.chat()` and the bridge
calls this for you.

**Parameters:**

- `request: IRChatRequest` - Request in Intermediate Representation form
- `signal?: AbortSignal` - Cancellation signal

**Returns:** `Promise<IRChatResponse>`

---

### `executeStream(request, signal?)`

Execute a streaming IR request. It is an async generator method, so the stream is
returned synchronously - there is nothing to `await` before iterating.

**Parameters:**

- `request: IRChatRequest`
- `signal?: AbortSignal`

**Returns:** `IRChatStream` (`AsyncGenerator<IRStreamChunk>`)

:::caution[Streaming does not fall back]
If the selected backend fails mid-stream, `executeStream()` yields a single
`error` chunk and ends. The fallback chain applies to `execute()` only.
:::

---

### `register(name, adapter, options?)`

Register a backend under a name. The name is what you use in fallback chains,
model mappings, per-request overrides and statistics.

**Parameters:**

- `name: string` - Backend identifier
- `adapter: BackendAdapter` - Backend adapter instance
- `options?: BackendRegistrationOptions` - Per-backend settings (see
  [Per-backend circuit breaker](#per-backend-circuit-breaker))

**Returns:** `Router` (for chaining)

**Example:**

```typescript
import { GroqBackendAdapter } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-backend/groq';

router.register('groq', new GroqBackendAdapter({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY! }));
```

---

### `replace(name, adapter)` / `unregister(name, options?)`

Swap a registered backend for another instance, or remove one. Both return the
router for chaining. Unregistering the backend named by `defaultBackend` clears
`defaultBackend` and emits a `routing-config-changed` warning through
`config.onWarning`. `replace()` keeps the per-backend options given to
`register()` (they are policy about the name, like latency history) and resets
the health verdict.

```typescript
router.replace('openai', new OpenAIBackendAdapter({ apiKey: rotatedKey }));
router.unregister('groq');
```

#### Unregistering with requests in flight

`unregister()` is **not cancellation**. A call already handed to the backend runs
to its natural end: an `execute()` resolves and a stream keeps yielding, because
the call holds the adapter it started on. From the moment `unregister()` returns:

- no new request is routed to the name;
- the circuit-breaker recovery timer is cancelled;
- the in-flight call's outcome is **not accounted** - no counters, no stats, no
  breaker. The backend is gone, so a late failure must not land on an object
  nobody can read, nor trip the breaker of a different backend registered under
  the same name afterwards.

To wait for in-flight calls, pass `drain`. The backend is still removed
synchronously; you get a promise that settles when the calls have finished
(streams included) or the timeout passed:

```typescript
router.unregister('desktop');                                  // Router, synchronously

const result = await router.unregister('desktop', { drain: true });
//    { drained: true, inFlight: 0 }   -- safe to dispose of the adapter now

await router.unregister('desktop', { drain: 5_000 });
//    { drained: false, inFlight: 1 }  -- gave up after 5 s; the call still finishes
```

A stream the consumer never finishes or closes keeps its backend "in flight", so
use a timeout when you cannot guarantee consumers read to the end. The number of
calls currently running is `getBackendInfo(name).inFlight`.

#### Revoking with `abort`

By default `unregister()` stops *new* work only. If the answer must not be
*delivered* - a revoked device, a rotated credential - pass `{ abort: true }`:

```typescript
router.unregister('desktop', { abort: true });                       // cut, now
await router.unregister('desktop', { abort: true, drain: 5_000 });   // cut, then wait for unwinding
```

The router owns an `AbortController` per call, linked to the caller's own signal
(so the caller keeps its control), and `abort` fires every one running against that
backend - chat, stream, embedding and decision calls alike:

- the adapter's `AbortSignal` aborts with an `AbortError`, and
  `adapter.cancel?.(requestId, reason)` is called once for the call, for a far side
  that cannot see a signal (best effort; a throwing or rejecting `cancel()` is ignored);
- the caller receives that `AbortError` whatever the adapter made of the abort, even
  an adapter that ignores its signal. A stream ends by throwing it, and nothing the
  revoked backend yields afterwards is delivered;
- **it is not failed over.** The router does not answer from another backend a request
  it was just told to cut; the caller decides whether to retry;
- calls on other backends are untouched, and the cut calls' late outcomes are not
  accounted, as for any unregistered backend.

`cancel()` is sent for revocation only. A *caller's* abort is not relayed by the router
(a proxy behind a router watches the signal itself; `Bridge` sends `cancel()` for a
direct backend), so no far side is told twice. Whether a transport really stops is still
the adapter's business; revocation guarantees only that the caller is released and gets
nothing further.

---

### `get(name)` / `has(name)` / `listBackends()`

Inspect the registry.

```typescript
router.get('openai');      // BackendAdapter | undefined
router.has('openai');      // boolean
router.listBackends();     // readonly string[]
```

---

### `setFallbackChain(chain)` / `getFallbackChain()`

Set the order backends are tried in after the primary fails. Every name must
already be registered, otherwise an `AdapterError` with
`ErrorCode.ROUTING_FAILED` is thrown. Without a chain, `'sequential'` fallback
tries every other available backend in registration order.

```typescript
router.setFallbackChain(['openai', 'groq']);
router.getFallbackChain(); // readonly string[]
```

---

### `setModelMapping(mapping)` / `getModelMapping()`

Map model names to backend names, for `routingStrategy: 'model-based'`.

```typescript
router.setModelMapping({
  'gpt-4': 'openai',
  'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001': 'anthropic',
});
```

---

### `selectBackend(request, preferredBackend?)`

Run the routing strategy and return the chosen backend name without executing
anything. Useful in tests.

**Returns:** `Promise<string>` - throws `ErrorCode.NO_BACKEND_AVAILABLE` if nothing is available.

---

### `dispatchParallel(request, options?)`

Send one request to several backends at once.

**Parameters:**

- `request: IRChatRequest`
- `options?: ParallelDispatchOptions`

**Returns:** `Promise<ParallelDispatchResult>`

```typescript
const result = await router.dispatchParallel(irRequest, {
  backends: ['openai', 'anthropic'],
  strategy: 'first',
});

console.log(result.response, result.successfulBackends, result.totalTimeMs);
```

---

### `decide(request, signal?)`

Answer typed decision questions via the best available backend. Mirrors
`embed()`: candidates are registered backends that implement `decide()`, whose
circuit is not open, and that can serve the request (a backend whose
`decisionTypes`, `decisionLimits` or `decisionImages` rule it out is skipped,
not failed). They are tried in fallback-chain order, then the default backend,
then registration order.

**Parameters:**

- `request: IRDecisionRequest`
- `signal?: AbortSignal`

**Returns:** `Promise<IRDecisionResponse>`

```typescript
const response = await router.decide({
  state: ticket,
  questions,
  metadata: { requestId: 'r1', timestamp: Date.now() },
});
```

`parameters.model` is a hint: a candidate that declares `decisionModels` without
it is tried after the rest, not excluded. Throws `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE` when no
backend supports decisions.

---

### `checkHealth(name?)`

Actively probe backends by calling each adapter's `healthCheck()`. An adapter
that does not implement `healthCheck()` is reported healthy.

**Returns:** `Promise<Record<string, boolean>>`, or `Promise<boolean>` when a name is given.

```typescript
const health = await router.checkHealth();
// { anthropic: true, openai: true, groq: false }

const openaiHealthy = await router.checkHealth('openai');
```

Set `healthCheckInterval` in the config to run this automatically in the
background.

---

### `getBackendInfo(name?)`

Report the last known state of each backend - health, circuit breaker, and stats -
without probing.

**Returns:** `BackendInfo[]`, or `BackendInfo | undefined` when a name is given.

```typescript
for (const info of router.getBackendInfo()) {
  console.log(
    info.name,
    info.isHealthy ? '✅' : '❌',
    info.circuitBreakerState,
    `${info.stats.averageLatencyMs}ms`,
    `${info.stats.successRate}%`
  );
}
```

---

### Circuit breaker controls

```typescript
router.openCircuitBreaker('openai', 30_000); // force open; 30 s is the rest period of THIS open
router.closeCircuitBreaker('openai');
router.resetCircuitBreaker();                // all backends when name is omitted
router.isCircuitBreakerOpen('openai');       // boolean
```

`openCircuitBreaker(name, timeoutMs)` rests for exactly `timeoutMs`, in either
direction: a value longer than the configured timeout is honoured, not capped by
it. It applies only to that open.

#### Per-backend circuit breaker

`enableCircuitBreaker`, `circuitBreakerThreshold`, `circuitBreakerTimeout` and
`circuitBreakerWindow` on `RouterConfig` are **defaults**. One router often fronts backends that fail very
differently - a cloud API that blips for seconds and a LAN peer that is asleep
overnight - so `register()` takes per-backend overrides; any field you leave out
inherits the router-wide value:

```typescript
const router = new Router({
  enableCircuitBreaker: true,
  circuitBreakerThreshold: 5,       // default for every backend
  circuitBreakerTimeout: 60_000,
});

router
  // Cloud API: tolerate a few blips, retry soon.
  .register('openai', openai, { circuitBreaker: { threshold: 5, timeout: 15_000 } })
  // LAN peer / docker container: a refused connection means "asleep", not "flaky".
  // Trip fast, and rest for five minutes before probing it again.
  .register('desktop', desktopTunnel, { circuitBreaker: { threshold: 2, timeout: 5 * 60_000 } })
  // A backend that should never be rested.
  .register('local', localModel, { circuitBreaker: { enabled: false } });

router.getBackendInfo('desktop')?.circuitBreaker;
// { enabled: true, threshold: 2, timeout: 300000, window: undefined, countAsFailure: fn,
//   source: { enabled: 'router', threshold: 'register', timeout: 'register', ... } }
```

`threshold` must be a positive integer and `timeout` a non-negative number of
milliseconds; anything else throws from `register()` before the backend is added.
`enabled: true` gives one backend a breaker in a router that has none.
`getBackendInfo()` reports the effective values, so you can see which layer won.
The overrides survive `replace()` and `clone()`.

##### Failure window

By default the breaker counts **consecutive** failures with no notion of elapsed time:
three refusals in four milliseconds trip it exactly like three failures over three
minutes, and a success in between resets the count. That is the backward-compatible
default and stays the behaviour unless you set a `window`.

`window` (milliseconds, per backend or as `RouterConfig.circuitBreakerWindow`) changes
the question to "`threshold` failures **within** `window`":

```typescript
router.register('desktop', tunnel, { circuitBreaker: { threshold: 3, window: 10_000 } });
```

Timestamps of recent failures are kept per backend and pruned to the window. In windowed
mode a success does *not* reset them (intermittent failure is still failure); they are
forgotten when the breaker closes or is reset. A failed half-open probe reopens a windowed
breaker at once.

##### Slow-start tolerance

A desktop loading a 7B model has a legitimate 40 s time-to-first-token that is not a
failure. No threshold or timeout says so; a *signal* does:

- An adapter that can tell reports `ErrorCode.MODEL_LOADING` (a retryable
  `ProviderError`). The default `countAsFailure` predicate does not count it toward the
  breaker, though it still appears in `failedRequests`. The shipped Ollama adapter (a 503
  "loading model", or a deadline that expired while `/api/ps` shows the model not
  resident), `native-model-runner` (a request while `start()` is waiting for the process)
  and `native-node-llamacpp` (a request while another request's load is running) report it.
- `countAsFailure?: (error) => boolean` replaces the default for one backend. It receives
  the thrown value, or the `{ code, message }` of an in-band stream error chunk. It
  *replaces* the default, so one that should still ignore warm-up must say so; a predicate
  that throws counts the failure.

```typescript
router.register('desktop', tunnel, {
  circuitBreaker: { countAsFailure: (e) => (e as { code?: string }).code !== 'PROVIDER_TIMEOUT' },
});
```

##### Adapter-declared policy

An adapter distributed as a package can recommend its own policy in
`AdapterMetadata.circuitBreaker` (`threshold`, `timeout`, `window`, `countAsFailure`;
never `enabled` - whether breakers run at all is the application's call). Precedence,
per field: **`register()` option > adapter metadata > `RouterConfig`**.
`getBackendInfo(name).circuitBreaker.source` reports the layer (`'register' | 'adapter' |
'router'`) each field came from. The recommendation is read from the adapter currently
registered, so `replace()` hands the name the replacement's. An invalid recommendation
throws from `register()`/`replace()` like an invalid override.

---

### `getStats()` / `resetStats()` / `getBackendStats(name)`

```typescript
const stats = router.getStats();
console.log(stats.totalRequests, stats.totalFallbacks, stats.backendStats);

const openaiStats = router.getBackendStats('openai'); // BackendStats | undefined
router.resetStats();
```

---

### `clone(config)` / `dispose()`

`clone()` returns a new router with merged config and the same backends
registered. `dispose()` stops the background health-check timer and clears the
registry - call it when tearing down.

---

## Types

### `RouterConfig`

Configuration options for Router. Every field is optional and `readonly`.

```typescript
interface RouterConfig {
  routingStrategy?: RoutingStrategy;          // default 'explicit'
  fallbackStrategy?: FallbackStrategy;        // default 'sequential'
  defaultBackend?: string;
  healthCheckInterval?: number;               // ms; 0 disables. default 0
  enableCircuitBreaker?: boolean;             // default false
  circuitBreakerThreshold?: number;           // default 5
  circuitBreakerTimeout?: number;             // ms, default 60000
  trackLatency?: boolean;                     // default true
  trackCost?: boolean;                        // default false
  capabilityBasedRouting?: boolean;           // default false
  optimization?: 'cost' | 'speed' | 'quality' | 'balanced';  // default 'balanced'
  optimizationWeights?: { cost: number; speed: number; quality: number };
  capabilityCacheDuration?: number;           // ms, default 3600000
  customRouter?: CustomRoutingFunction;
  customFallback?: CustomFallbackFunction;
  modelTranslation?: ModelTranslationConfig;
  onWarning?: (warning: IRWarning) => void;
}
```

---

### `RoutingStrategy`

```typescript
type RoutingStrategy =
  | 'explicit'           // Use the backend named on the request (default)
  | 'model-based'        // Route by model name via setModelMapping()
  | 'cost-optimized'     // Lowest observed average cost (needs trackCost)
  | 'latency-optimized'  // Lowest observed average latency (needs trackLatency)
  | 'round-robin'        // Distribute evenly
  | 'random'             // Random selection
  | 'custom';            // Use config.customRouter
```

There is no `'priority'`, `'weighted'`, `'least-latency'` or `'least-cost'`
strategy. Priority-style failover is `'explicit'` + `defaultBackend` +
`setFallbackChain()`.

---

### `FallbackStrategy`

```typescript
type FallbackStrategy =
  | 'none'        // Fail immediately
  | 'sequential'  // Try backends in order until one succeeds (default)
  | 'parallel'    // Try all remaining backends at once, take the first success
  | 'custom';     // Use config.customFallback
```

---

### `CustomRoutingFunction`

```typescript
type CustomRoutingFunction = (
  request: IRChatRequest,
  availableBackends: readonly string[],
  context: RoutingContext
) => Promise<string | null>;
```

**Returns:** the **name** of the backend to use, or `null` to fall through to
`defaultBackend` and then the first available backend. It is async, and it
receives backend names - not adapters, and not indices.

**Example:**

```typescript
import type { CustomRoutingFunction } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-types';

const selectBackend: CustomRoutingFunction = async (request, availableBackends) => {
  const wordCount = request.messages
    .map((m) => JSON.stringify(m.content).split(' ').length)
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

  const preferred =
    wordCount < 10 ? 'groq' : wordCount < 100 ? 'openai' : 'anthropic';

  return availableBackends.includes(preferred) ? preferred : (availableBackends[0] ?? null);
};

const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'custom', customRouter: selectBackend });
```

---

### `CustomFallbackFunction`

```typescript
type CustomFallbackFunction = (
  request: IRChatRequest,
  failedBackend: string,
  error: AdapterError,
  attemptedBackends: readonly string[],
  availableBackends: readonly string[]
) => Promise<string | null>;
```

---

### `RoutingContext`

```typescript
interface RoutingContext {
  readonly stats: RouterStats;
  readonly metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
  readonly preferredBackend?: string;
}
```

---

### `BackendInfo`

```typescript
interface BackendInfo {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly adapter: BackendAdapter;
  readonly metadata: AdapterMetadata;
  readonly isHealthy: boolean;
  readonly lastHealthCheck?: number;
  readonly circuitBreakerState: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open';
  readonly consecutiveFailures: number;
  readonly circuitBreaker: { enabled: boolean; threshold: number; timeout: number };
  readonly inFlight: number;
  readonly stats: BackendStats;
}
```

---

### `RouterStats` / `BackendStats`

```typescript
interface RouterStats {
  readonly totalRequests: number;
  readonly successfulRequests: number;
  readonly failedRequests: number;
  readonly totalFallbacks: number;
  readonly parallelRequests: number;
  readonly backendStats: Record<string, BackendStats>;
  readonly sinceTimestamp: number;
}

interface BackendStats {
  readonly totalRequests: number;
  readonly successfulRequests: number;
  readonly failedRequests: number;
  readonly successRate: number;       // 0-100
  readonly averageLatencyMs: number;
  readonly p50LatencyMs: number;
  readonly p95LatencyMs: number;
  readonly p99LatencyMs: number;
  readonly totalCost?: number;
  readonly averageCost?: number;
}
```

---

### `ParallelDispatchOptions` / `ParallelDispatchResult`

```typescript
interface ParallelDispatchOptions {
  readonly backends?: readonly string[];
  readonly strategy?: ParallelStrategy;     // default 'first'
  readonly timeout?: number;
  readonly cancelOnFirstSuccess?: boolean;  // default true
  readonly customAggregator?: (
    responses: Array<{ backend: string; response: IRChatResponse; latencyMs: number }>
  ) => IRChatResponse;
}

interface ParallelDispatchResult {
  readonly response: IRChatResponse;
  readonly allResponses?: Array<{
    readonly backend: string;
    readonly response: IRChatResponse;
    readonly latencyMs: number;
  }>;
  readonly successfulBackends: readonly string[];
  readonly failedBackends: Array<{ readonly backend: string; readonly error: AdapterError }>;
  readonly totalTimeMs: number;
}
```

---

## Routing Strategies

### Round-Robin

Distributes requests evenly across the available backends.

```typescript
const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'round-robin' });
router
  .register('backend1', backend1)
  .register('backend2', backend2)
  .register('backend3', backend3);

// Request 1 → backend1
// Request 2 → backend2
// Request 3 → backend3
// Request 4 → backend1 (cycles)
```

**Use case:** Even load distribution, all providers have similar pricing/performance.

---

### Random

Randomly selects an available backend for each request.

```typescript
const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'random' });
router.register('backend1', backend1).register('backend2', backend2);
```

**Use case:** Simple distribution, A/B testing.

---

### Explicit + Fallback Chain (Failover)

The equivalent of a "priority" strategy: always start at one backend, then walk a
chain.

```typescript
const router = new Router({
  routingStrategy: 'explicit',
  defaultBackend: 'primary',
  fallbackStrategy: 'sequential',
});

router
  .register('primary', primaryBackend)
  .register('secondary', secondaryBackend)
  .register('tertiary', tertiaryBackend);

router.setFallbackChain(['secondary', 'tertiary']);
```

**Use case:** High availability, disaster recovery, primary + fallback providers.

---

### Model-Based

```typescript
const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'model-based' });
router.register('openai', openaiBackend).register('anthropic', anthropicBackend);

router.setModelMapping({
  'gpt-4': 'openai',
  'gpt-5.6-luna': 'openai',
  'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001': 'anthropic',
});
```

**Use case:** One endpoint serving several providers' model catalogues.

---

### Latency-Optimized

Selects the backend with the lowest observed average latency. Needs
`trackLatency` (on by default) and some traffic history to work from.

```typescript
const router = new Router({
  routingStrategy: 'latency-optimized',
  trackLatency: true,
  healthCheckInterval: 60_000,
});
```

**Use case:** Optimize for response time, latency-sensitive applications.

---

### Cost-Optimized

Selects the backend with the lowest observed average cost. Requires
`trackCost: true` and backends that implement `estimateCost()`; without it the
strategy selects nothing and the router falls through to `defaultBackend`.

```typescript
const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'cost-optimized', trackCost: true });
```

**Use case:** Cost optimization, budget-conscious applications.

---

### Custom

```typescript
import type { CustomRoutingFunction } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-types';

const selectBackend: CustomRoutingFunction = async (request, availableBackends) => {
  const wordCount = request.messages
    .map((m) => JSON.stringify(m.content).split(' ').length)
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

  if (wordCount < 10) return 'groq';       // Simple → fast/cheap
  if (wordCount < 100) return 'openai';    // Medium → balanced
  return 'anthropic';                      // Complex → powerful
};

const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'custom', customRouter: selectBackend });
router
  .register('groq', groqBackend)
  .register('openai', openaiBackend)
  .register('anthropic', anthropicBackend);
```

**Use case:** Application-specific logic, multi-factor routing.

---

## Health Monitoring

### Automatic Health Checks

Set `healthCheckInterval` (milliseconds; `0` disables) and the router probes every
backend in the background, marking failures unhealthy so routing skips them.

```typescript
const router = new Router({
  routingStrategy: 'round-robin',
  healthCheckInterval: 60_000,
  enableCircuitBreaker: true,
  circuitBreakerThreshold: 5,
  circuitBreakerTimeout: 60_000,
});
```

There is no event emitter on `Router`; poll `getBackendInfo()` to observe state.

---

### Manual Health Check

```typescript
const health = await router.checkHealth();

for (const [name, healthy] of Object.entries(health)) {
  if (!healthy) {
    const info = router.getBackendInfo(name);
    console.log(`⚠️  ${name} is unhealthy`);
    console.log(`  Success rate: ${info?.stats.successRate.toFixed(1)}%`);
    console.log(`  Consecutive failures: ${info?.consecutiveFailures}`);
    console.log(`  Circuit breaker: ${info?.circuitBreakerState}`);
  }
}
```

---

## Advanced Examples

### Cost-Optimized Routing (per request)

```typescript
import type { CustomRoutingFunction } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-types';

const PRICING: Record<string, number> = {
  groq: 0.00027,
  deepseek: 0.0002,
  anthropic: 0.0008,
  openai: 0.0015,
};

const cheapest: CustomRoutingFunction = async (request, availableBackends) => {
  const tokens = Math.ceil(JSON.stringify(request.messages).length / 4);

  let best: string | null = null;
  let lowestCost = Infinity;

  for (const name of availableBackends) {
    const cost = ((PRICING[name] ?? Infinity) * tokens) / 1000;
    if (cost < lowestCost) {
      lowestCost = cost;
      best = name;
    }
  }

  return best;
};

const router = new Router({ routingStrategy: 'custom', customRouter: cheapest });
```

---

### Multi-Factor Routing

`availableBackends` already excludes unhealthy and circuit-open backends, so a
custom router only has to weigh the factors it cares about.

```typescript
import type { CustomRoutingFunction } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-types';

const intelligentRouting: CustomRoutingFunction = async (request, availableBackends, context) => {
  if (availableBackends.length === 0) return null;

  const complexity = analyzeComplexity(request);
  const hour = new Date().getHours();

## Error Handling

### Automatic Fallback

```typescript
const router = new Router({
  routingStrategy: 'explicit',
  defaultBackend: 'primary',
  fallbackStrategy: 'sequential',
});

router.register('primary', primaryBackend).register('fallback', fallbackBackend);
router.setFallbackChain(['fallback']);

const bridge = new Bridge(new OpenAIFrontendAdapter(), router);

// If primary fails, this automatically uses fallback
const response = await bridge.chat(request);

// Afterwards, the counters tell you whether a fallback happened
console.log(router.getStats().totalFallbacks);
```

### Manual Error Handling

Routing failures surface as `AdapterError` with a routing error code. There is no
`AllBackendsFailedError` class - check `error.code` instead.

```typescript
import { AdapterError, ErrorCode } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-errors';

try {
  const response = await bridge.chat(request);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof AdapterError) {
    switch (error.code) {
      case ErrorCode.ALL_BACKENDS_FAILED:
        console.error('Every backend in the chain failed');
        break;
      case ErrorCode.NO_BACKEND_AVAILABLE:
        console.error('No healthy backend to route to');
        break;
      case ErrorCode.ROUTING_FAILED:
        console.error('Routing rejected the request (e.g. unknown backend name)');
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

`RouterError` (a subclass of `AdapterError`) carries an `attemptedBackends`
array when it is thrown.
