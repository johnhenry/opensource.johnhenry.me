Two kinds of example live here. The numbered `NN-*.mjs` files are runnable, self-verifying Node scripts: each one
asserts the behavior it demonstrates and exits 0 on success, so `npm run examples` is a smoke test (CI runs it). The
`*.html` pages are a browser demo site with live checks on every page. Nothing is simulated in either: the Node
scripts run the real scanner, compiler, loader and runtime, and use [linkedom](https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom)
(a dev dependency) only as the DOM where one is needed.

## Node examples

| Example | Demonstrates |
| --- | --- |
| `01-a-module-reads-into-a-json-record.mjs` | `scanHTMLModule()` reads `components/ui.html` into a plain-JSON module record (four components, one of them the default, and a JSON data export; the unexported paragraph is absent), and `readHTMLModule()` over a parsed DOM produces the **same** record. That agreement is what keeps compiled and runtime-loaded modules identical. |
| `02-tags-are-namespace-delimiter-export.mjs` | `bindingName()` makes `<ui--card>` by default and `<ui-card>` with `"-"`; `"."` with a one-word export is **rejected** with a `SyntaxError` naming `<ui.card>` and "it has no hyphen"; `parseBindingName()` returns `null` for an ambiguous tag; `isValidDelimiter()` rejects `""`, `" "`, `":"` and upper case; `elementNameProblem()` explains, in words, why a name is invalid. |
| `03-compiled-output-is-a-plain-es-module.mjs` | `compileHTMLModule()` turns `rating.html` (which imports `icons.html` and `themes.html`) into an ES module whose only library import is `@johnhenry/html-modules/runtime` and whose `.html` dependencies are rewritten to `.js`; the compiled files import in plain Node and export definitions that keep their identity and their module's imports, and **nothing is registered**. The `register` format emits a `registerComponents()` call, and an invalid tag is rejected at compile time. |
| `04-invalid-modules-fail-with-a-named-syntax-error.mjs` | 38 kinds of broken module (missing `name`, bad names, duplicate and double defaults, two templates, bad `shadow`/`delegates-focus`, invalid JSON, `@import` in a `<style>`, a bad `integrity`, a lazy import that adopts or has no tag to wait for, a misplaced `<html-binding>`, misplaced or duplicate settings, …) each fail with the documented `SyntaxError`, naming the module, **identically** through the scanner, the DOM reader and the compiler. |
| `05-html-import-registers-and-upgrades-in-place.mjs` | In a linkedom window, `<html-import src as="ui">` registers `<ui--card>` and friends (not the data export), and an element written **before** the import upgrades in place with its light DOM slotted; `el.tags` records `{ tag, namespace, export }`; one definition is registered under several tags as distinct subclasses; a second namespace reuses the cached module (**one fetch**); a tag already held by a different definition is an error unless `conflict: 'reuse'`, which records `reused: true`; `<html-binding>` children bind only what they name. |
| `06-lazy-import-fetches-on-first-use.mjs` | Under `<html-import-settings load="lazy">`, imports fetch **nothing** until one of their tags appears (another namespace's tags do not count), while `load="eager"` on one import overrides the setting; the first `<ui--…>` loads, registers and upgrades; `el.load()` forces a load; `HTMLModules.import(src, { load: 'lazy' })` returns a handle (not a promise) with `state`, `load()` and `cancel()`. |

## Browser pages

Serve the package root and open `/examples/` (for example `python3 -m http.server`, then
`http://localhost:8000/examples/`). Every page works offline and shows pass/fail checks for what it demonstrates;
`index.html` is a hub with a coverage checklist (`shared/catalog.js`) mapping every capability to
the pages that cover it.

| Example | Demonstrates |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | The hub: every page, and a checklist of every capability with the pages that prove it. |
| `quickstart.html` | One script and one `<html-import src as>`; namespaced elements written before the import upgrade in place when the module arrives. |
| `library.html` | A component library written in HTML (`components/`): templates, styles, slots and parts, a default export, data, stylesheets, a module importing another, and barrels using every re-export form (list, namespace, default); one cache entry per URL. |
| `namespaces.html` | `as="ui"` makes `<ui--card>`, `delimiter="-"` makes `<ui-card>`; one module under several namespaces; a bare specifier resolved through the page's import map; which delimiters the live registry accepts. |
| `bindings.html` | `<html-binding>`: bind only what the page uses, choose tags, adopt stylesheets, read data, bind a default export, load for side effects, and add bindings after load. |
| `identity.html` | One definition, many tags (`define()`, `element=`, two namespaces), each a subclass of one base element; a default export has no name, so the importer names it. |
| `interop.html` | JS modules (`interop/`): a `components` manifest, `defineHTMLComponent()` exports, a plain class bound by name, JS behaviour on an HTML template, and HTML re-exporting JS. |
| `styles.html` | Component styles, theming through custom properties and `::part`, switching adopted theme stylesheets, and stylesheets a module adopts only for its own components. |
| `errors.html` | Every error, triggered on purpose (the broken modules in `errors/`), with the event it fires and its message. |
| `compiler.html` | `compiled/*.js` (from `npm run examples:compile`) next to their HTML sources; a runtime frame and a compiled frame (`compiler/`) render **identical** shadow roots and styles; `export default`; register builds with and without `--delimiter`; an in-browser compiler. |
| `app.html` | A reading-list app (`app/`) assembled from HTML modules: components, icons, JSON seed data, a theme, and one JS component. |
| `settings.html` | `<html-import-settings>` (`settings/` frames): a page-wide delimiter, a `base` switching a vendored library between `vendor/ui@1/` and `vendor/ui@2/`, `conflict="reuse"` letting a compiled and a runtime copy share a page, `errors="throw"` reaching `window.onerror`, lexical scope, and `<html-module-settings>` (closed shadow roots by default). |
| `lazy.html` | `load="lazy"` with a live network panel: each module fetched only when its first element appears, including inside a component's shadow root, a binding's exact tag, a module's own lazy import, `el.load()`, disconnecting before load, and a lazy `HTMLModules.import()` handle. |
| `scripting.html` | Live checks for driving the library from script: a scripted `<html-import>` (`createElement`, `append`, then set `src` and `as`; reflected properties; changing `src` after loading started is an error), un-adopting a stylesheet, `HTMLModules.unload()`, server-rendered (declarative) shadow DOM, open and closed, with `renderDeclarative()`, markup mistakes that used to be silent (a self-closed `<html-binding />`, a lazy import with nothing to wait for), and the security options (`integrity`, `credentials`, `mode`, a Trusted Types policy). |

Supporting folders, used by the pages above (not pages themselves): `components/` (the HTML component library),
`app/`, `interop/`, `errors/` (intentionally broken modules), `vendor/` (two versions of a vendored library),
`compiler/` and `settings/` (framed sub-pages), `compiled/` (generated; do not edit), and `shared/` (site script,
stylesheet and the coverage catalog).

## Running

```sh
npm run examples      # run every Node example in sequence
npm run example:01    # run one
node examples/01-a-module-reads-into-a-json-record.mjs
npm run examples:compile   # regenerate examples/compiled/ after changing a compiled source
```

## Runtime requirements (honest edition)

The Node examples run under **plain Node >= 26** with the dev dependencies installed (`npm ci`), and need no
network: example files import the package by its own name (`@johnhenry/html-modules`, a package self-reference), and
examples 01, 04, 05 and 06 use linkedom as the DOM. linkedom is a stand-in, not a browser. It has no constructable
stylesheets (component styles fall back to a `<style>` per shadow root), it does not upgrade custom elements inside
shadow roots, and it does not carry events out of shadow roots, so nothing here proves real-browser rendering,
adopted stylesheets or composed events.

The browser pages cover exactly that, and are **not** part of `npm run examples`: they need a browser and a static
server. Their logic is covered headlessly by `test/examples.test.js`, which checks that
every example HTML module reads the same through the DOM and the scanner and loads (the ones in `errors/` fail with
the documented messages), that `compiled/` is up to date, that the catalog covers every checklist item, and that
every page references only local files. This exception is intentional, not an oversight.
