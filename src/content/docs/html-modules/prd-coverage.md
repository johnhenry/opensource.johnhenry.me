The authoritative spec is the PRD **"Declarative HTML Modules"** (and the conversation that produced it).
This document maps each PRD section onto the code as it stood at the start of the refocus
(commit `2e04caa`, the rename), and says what to **keep**, **change**, **remove** or **add**.

## Where the code started

The library had grown out of a different conversation, about routing JavaScript imports across CDNs
(which became the separate [mport](https://github.com/johnhenry/mport) library). Its source was about 1,900 lines:

| Area | Files | What it did |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML module format | `html-module.js`, `namespace.js` | Any element with an `export="…"` attribute was an export: `<template export>` → `HTMLTemplateElement`, `<style export>` → `CSSStyleSheet`, `<script type=module export>` → a JS namespace, JSON scripts, `<svg export>`. Re-exports through `<module-export from>`. Produced a frozen, ESM-like namespace. |
| Declarative imports | `declarations.js`, `elements.js`, `scope.js`, `interpret.js` | `<module-import from>` with `<module-binding name as element adopt>` children, `default=` and `namespace=` locals held in a per-document `ModuleScope`, `<define-element name component>` for later registration, template → shadow-stamping class, one export registered under several tags via subclasses. |
| Loader | `loader.js` | Resolution through an import map, then a **router**, then `hostResolve`; a URL-keyed promise cache; `onEvent`; deadlock-free re-export cycle detection. |
| Package routing | `routers/*` (basic, import-map, mport adapter `fromMport`), `import-map.js` | Import-map resolution and compilation, an mport-format lockfile, router chaining. |
| CLI | `bin/…` | `build` (import map + lockfile + `--html`) and `resolve`. |
| Demo | 13 pages | Mostly routing, CDN, import-map, lockfile and loader-hook pages. |

There was **no namespaced registration, no component-definition object, no compiler** and no
JS-authored component protocol.

## Section by section

| PRD section | Status before | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §1 Executive summary: HTML format, declarative import, namespacing, JS runtime, compiler, shared definition, JS interop | Only the first two, under different names | **Change / add** everything below. |
| §3 Design philosophy: loading → parsing → export discovery → namespace binding → definition → registration → instantiation as separate stages | Loading and binding existed; definition and registration were fused in `interpret.js` | **Change**: separate `record` (parse output), `definition` (`defineHTMLComponent`), binding (`bindModule`) and registration (`definition.define(tag)`). |
| §4 Goals | Partly | See rows below. |
| §5 Non-goals: no custom JS loader, no service worker, no bundler, import maps not responsible for HTML | **Violated in spirit**: routers, CDN routing, import-map compilation and lockfiles were core features | **Remove** `src/routers/*`, `fromMport`, `compileImportMap`, lockfiles, the mport peer and dev dependency, the CLI build. Resolution becomes standard: relative to the importing document or module, bare specifiers through the page's own import map (`import.meta.resolve`) via a `hostResolve` hook. mport stays a separate library for package/CDN routing. |
| §6 No direct `import "./ui.html"` from JS | Held | **Keep**. JS gets `HTMLModules.load()` and the compiler instead. |
| §7 Core concepts: module, export, import, component definition, import binding (include later) | Module, export, import only | **Add** the component definition and the binding as first-class objects. HTML Include is deferred (see below). |
| §8 HTML module = ordinary HTML with one or more exports | Held (any HTML) | **Keep**. |
| §9 Export syntax `<html-export name="…"><template>…</template></html-export>`, preferred over `<template export>` and `data-*`; metadata such as `shadow` only with concrete semantics | Used `export="…"` attributes on built-in elements, which §9.1 explicitly rejects | **Change** to `<html-export name>`. Implemented metadata with concrete semantics only: `shadow="open\|closed"`, `delegates-focus`, `default`. Default exports are spelled `name="default"` (see the extension below). `<style>` children of an export become the definition's `styles` (one constructed sheet shared by every instance). |
| §10 Templates as the V1 payload, native `<slot>` | Held (template stamped into an open shadow root) | **Keep**, moved into the shared runtime. |
| §11 `<html-import src as>` = `import * as ui`; `as` is a namespace, not a rename | `<module-import from namespace=>` bound a JS-style local, not elements | **Change**: `<html-import src="./ui.html" as="ui">` registers every component export as `ui--<export>`. |
| §12 `--` namespace delimiter | Absent | **Add**. Namespaces and export names are lower-case kebab words, so neither can contain `--` and every tag splits unambiguously. Note: §12 says `.` is not permitted in custom element names; it is (`ui.custom-card` registers in current browsers, as the namespaces example shows live). The real problem with `.` is one-word exports: `ui.card` has no hyphen. `--` is still the right choice, and the docs give that reason instead. `--` stays the default; making it configurable is an extension (below). |
| §13 Identity vs registration name | Partly (`element=` chose the tag, but a template had no identity of its own) | **Add**: a definition carries its module-local `name`; the importer chooses the tag. The same definition can be bound as `ui--custom-card` and `admin--custom-card`. |
| §14 One constructor cannot be registered twice; use generated subclasses | Held (`renamedSubclass`) | **Keep**, moved into `definition.define()`: every registration is a fresh subclass of the definition's base element. |
| §15 Runtime loading: resolve, fetch, DOMParser, discover exports, create definitions, bind, register | Held, apart from definitions and namespaces | **Change** the pipeline to produce definitions. |
| §16 Module cache: `Map<ResolvedURL, Promise<HTMLModule>>` | Held | **Keep** (failed loads are evicted so they can be retried), keyed by kind and URL (`html:<url>`), with `HTMLModules.unload(src)` to evict on purpose. |
| §17 Asynchronous upgrade: elements may appear before their import finishes; native upgrade, no MutationObserver | Implicitly held | **Keep and test** explicitly, including `customElements.whenDefined` and `:not(:defined)`. |
| §18 HTML Component Definition `{ name, template, shadow, styles }` shared by runtime and compiler | Absent | **Add** `defineHTMLComponent()` in `src/runtime.js`, the only place component semantics live. |
| §19 Shared runtime architecture: browser loader and compiler both feed the same runtime | Absent | **Add**: both paths produce the same JSON-able module record (`readHTMLModule` from a DOM, `scanHTMLModule` from source text) and the same `defineHTMLComponent()` calls. |
| §20 Programmatic API `HTMLModules.load()`, sharing the cache and parser with `<html-import>` | `createLoader().load()` existed | **Change**: `HTMLModules.load / import / bind / resolve / cache`; `<html-import>` is a thin layer over the same instance. |
| §21 JS-authored components; a `components` manifest; never assume every JS export is a component | Any class could be bound, but there was no manifest protocol | **Add**: `<html-import src="./ui.js" as="ui">` registers the module's `components` manifest, or failing that its exports made with `defineHTMLComponent()`. Other exports (`VERSION`, `formatDate`) are never registered. JS classes can also be wrapped with `defineHTMLComponent(Class)`, and can extend an HTML definition's `.element`. |
| Compiler (conversation §3–§8, PRD §1, §6): `html-module ui.html -o ui.js`; exports are definitions and do not self-register; `.define(name)`; `--format register` as sugar; `compileHTMLModule(source)` in memory | Absent (the CLI compiled import maps instead) | **Add** `compileHTMLModule()` and the `html-module` CLI with `esm` (default) and `register` formats. The output imports only the runtime, exports one definition per component, a `components` manifest (so `<html-import src="./ui.js">` works on it too) and a default export when there is one. |

## Old capabilities: kept, renamed or removed

| Old capability | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| `<module-import>` / `<module-binding>` | **Renamed** to `<html-import>` / `<html-binding>` (see the extension below). |
| `<define-element name component>` | **Removed**. Its job (choosing a tag for one export) is `<html-binding export element>`, or `definition.define(tag)` in JS. |
| `<module-export from>` re-exports (barrels) | **Kept** as `<html-export src="…">` (`export *`), `<html-export src="…" name="x" import="y">` (one export, optionally renamed), and extended to every ESM form: `names="a, b as c"` (a list), `import="*"` (`export * as ns`), and `name="default"` (a default re-export). Sources may be HTML or JS modules. Cycle detection kept. |
| `<style export>` + `adopt` | **Kept** as a stylesheet export, `<html-export name="theme"><style>…</style></html-export>`, adopted with `<html-binding export="theme" adopt>` into the import's root (the document, or the shadow root that contains the import). |
| `<script type="application/json" export>` | **Kept** as a data export, `<html-export name="config"><script type="application/json">…</script></html-export>`. |
| `<script type="module" export>` inline scripts, `<svg export>`, arbitrary-element exports | **Removed**. Behaviour comes from JS modules (§21), not scripts embedded in HTML modules; the conversation defers hybrid script semantics past V1. |
| `ModuleScope`, `default=` / `namespace=` locals | **Removed**. HTML imports bind element names, not JS-style identifiers; values are exposed on the import element (`el.module`, `el.bindings`) and through `HTMLModules.load()`. |
| Loader cache, events, `fetch` / `parseHTML` hooks | **Kept** for tests and SSR, with events renamed to the new pipeline (`fetch`, `load`, `error`). |
| Import-map resolver, compiler, merge, script, routers, mport adapter, lockfile, CLI build/resolve | **Removed**. |

## Deliberate extension beyond the PRD: `<html-binding>`

The PRD specifies only the whole-namespace form, `<html-import src as>`. The user asked to keep the
capabilities of the old `<module-binding>` under the spec's vocabulary, as optional children of the
one import element:

```html
<html-import src="./ui.html" as="ui">
  <html-binding export="card"></html-binding>                          <!-- only this one: ui--card -->
  <html-binding export="button" element="brand-button"></html-binding>  <!-- an explicit tag -->
  <html-binding export="theme" adopt></html-binding>                   <!-- a stylesheet, adopted -->
</html-import>
<html-import src="./counter.js">
  <html-binding export="Counter" element="x-counter"></html-binding>
</html-import>
```

Rationale:

- **Registry pollution.** Custom-element names are global and permanent. Importing a large library
  as a namespace registers every export forever; selective bindings register only what the page uses.
- **Identity vs registration name (§13), declaratively.** `element=` is the markup form of
  `definition.define(tag)`, which the PRD already specifies for JS.
- **Non-element exports.** Stylesheets and data need a way to be used from markup (`adopt`,
  `el.bindings`) without being mistaken for components.
- **JS interop (§21).** Binding a named class from a plain JS module needs no manifest.

Rules: with no `<html-binding>` children, every component export is registered as `<as>--<export>`
(the PRD's behaviour). With any children, only those exports are bound. `element=` overrides the tag;
the same export may be bound to several tags (a subclass per tag). `export="default"` binds a default
export (it needs `element=`). An import with no `as` and no bindings still loads the module, for its
side effects and to warm the cache. Bindings added later, or before the module has loaded, are
applied when it is ready; elements already in the page upgrade natively. Failures (a missing export,
an invalid tag, a non-element bound to `element=`) fire an `error` event on the binding, which bubbles
through the import.

## Extension beyond the PRD: configurable namespace delimiter

The PRD (§12) fixes the delimiter at `--`. It stays the default everywhere, and can now be changed:

- per import: `<html-import src="./ui.html" as="ui" delimiter="-">` registers `<ui-custom-card>`;
- per call: `HTMLModules.import(src, { as, delimiter })`, `HTMLModules.bind(ns, { as, delimiter })`,
  `bindModule(ns, { as, delimiter })`, `registerComponents(ns, { as, delimiter })`;
- per instance: `createHTMLModules({ delimiter })` (the attribute and the options override it);
- in the compiler's register format: `compileHTMLModule(source, { format: 'register', as, delimiter })`,
  `html-module --format register --as ui --delimiter -`.

Rules. A delimiter is non-empty and made of characters allowed in custom element names (no upper case or
whitespace). Each resulting tag must be a valid custom element name; `delimiter="."` with a one-word export gives
`ui.card`, which has no hyphen, and fails with a `SyntaxError` naming the tag and the reason, through the usual
pathway (`error` events, rejections; a namespace import checks all its tags before registering any). With `-`,
tags can be ambiguous (`ui-custom-card`), so nothing parses tags: bindings record `{ tag, namespace, export }`
(`el.tags`, and `tags` in `bind()` / `import()` results). `parseBindingName(tag, delimiter)` survives only as a
display helper that returns `null` for a tag that does not split exactly one way. Module records carry an
import's `delimiter` when it is written, so the DOM reader and the scanner agree; inside modules an import without
one uses `--`, never the page's instance default, so a module's templates always match the tags they get.

## Extension beyond the PRD: settings elements and lazy loading

The PRD fixes the delimiter at `--` (§12) and has no settings element: every import is configured on its own
element, and every module loads when its import connects. Two elements now set defaults for one document, and
imports can load lazily.

| Addition | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `<html-import-settings delimiter base conflict load errors>` | defaults for the `<html-import>` elements of the document it is in: a page, or (read into the module record by both the DOM reader and the scanner) an HTML module |
| `<html-module-settings shadow delegates-focus>` | defaults for the component exports of the module it is in; baked into each component record, so runtime and compiled definitions agree |
| `conflict="reuse"` | keep a tag's existing, different definition instead of failing; recorded as `reused: true` in `el.tags` |
| `errors="throw"` | also `reportError()` binding and loading failures, for development |
| `base` | resolve a document's import (and re-export) specifiers against a folder, relative to the document's (or module's) own URL; the compiler rebases dependency specifiers the same way |
| `load="lazy"` | fetch a module only when one of its tags is used, watching the document and html-modules component shadow roots; `el.load()`, `el.state`, module-level lazy imports, `HTMLModules.import(src, { load: 'lazy' })` handles |

Rules, in brief ([Settings and lazy loading](/html-modules/settings-and-lazy-loading/) has them in full):

- **Scope is lexical.** A page's settings apply to that page's `<html-import>` elements, a module's to that module's
  own imports and exports. Page settings and `createHTMLModules()` options never reach modules: as with the
  delimiter rule above, a module's templates must keep matching the tags its author wrote.
- **Placement.** Before any `<html-import>` (or `<html-export>`), at most one per document. Late or duplicate
  settings are errors; in a page they are ignored and never retroactively change started imports; in a module they
  are `SyntaxError`s.
- **Precedence.** Per-import attribute > the document's `<html-import-settings>` > `createHTMLModules()` options
  (pages only) > built-in defaults. `base` is document-level only.
- **Validation.** Unknown attributes (other than `id`, `class`, `data-*`) and bad values are errors that list the
  valid values. Invalid page settings fail that page's imports, rather than letting them run with other options.
- **`<html-module-settings>` in a page** is an error event, not a silent no-op: a page has no exports.
- **Lazy loading is a runtime concern.** Compiled dependencies are static imports, so compiled registration is
  eager; `load` is carried in `$imports` for fidelity only. What lazy loading does not observe (shadow roots made by
  other code, iframes, template contents) is documented; `el.load()` covers those cases.

## Default export spellings

The PRD does not specify how a default export is written. The first implementation used a boolean `default`
attribute (`<html-export default>`, with `name` optional). That changed to mirror JS:

| Markup | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<html-export name="default">` | the default export (canonical), `export default` |
| `<html-export name>` (empty name) | the same; beware templating that renders `name=""` |
| `<html-export name="card" default>` | `card` and also the default, `export { card, card as default }` |
| `<html-export default>` | error: points to `name="default"` |
| no `name` and no `src` | error mentioning `name="default"` |
| two defaults (`name="default"` twice, or with `name="x" default`) | error |
| `name="default" default`, `default="yes"` | error |
| a star re-export (`src`, no `name`) with `default` | error: star re-exports are never the default |
| a re-export with `name="default"` (or empty), `import="x"`, or `name="x" default` | the default re-export: `export { default } from`, `export { x as default } from`, `export { x, x as default } from` |

`default` and `components` remain reserved as named exports. The default is never star re-exported, a
default-only component is not in the `components` manifest and is not registered by `as=` (the importer names it
with `<html-binding export="default" element="…">`), and components, stylesheets (`adopt`) and data can all be
bound as the default. The compiler emits `export default …`.

## Extension beyond the PRD: hardening and lifecycle

Added after an audit of the first build; none of it changes the PRD's model, and each item has its page in the API
reference.

| Addition | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `integrity` (SRI, SubtleCrypto), `credentials`, `mode`; the [Security model](/html-modules/security/) page | A module URL is as trusted as a `<script src>`: pinning and fetch options are the available levers. JavaScript modules cannot be verified by `import()` and are refused rather than trusted. |
| `sanitize` (a template sanitizer hook), `@johnhenry/html-modules/safe-fragment` | The residual risk of the row above, for modules from less-trusted origins: opt-in, fail-closed, [described below](#extension-beyond-the-prd-an-opt-in-template-sanitizer). |
| `trustedTypes` policy, `nonce`, `configureRuntime()` | `template.innerHTML` and the loader's parse of a fetched module throw under `require-trusted-types-for 'script'`; the `<style>` fallback needs a nonce under a strict `style-src`. |
| Relative `url()`s in a module's CSS rewritten to absolute against the module; `@import` is a `SyntaxError` | `url()` in a module's CSS belongs to the module. Browsers ignore `CSSStyleSheet`'s `baseURL`, so the CSS text is rewritten. `replaceSync()` silently drops `@import`. |
| A lazy import with nothing to wait for is an error | It could never load. (Before, `el.load()` was the only way; `HTMLModules.load()` does that now.) |
| `<html-import>` properties, deferred start, `src` change error | A scripted `createElement` / `append` / `setAttribute('src')` used to end in an error with no fetch. `load` is the method, so the attribute's property is `loadMode`. |
| A misplaced `<html-binding>` is an error | A self-closed `<html-binding />` nested the next binding, which was dropped silently. |
| `renderDeclarative()`, and keeping a server-rendered root | Declarative shadow DOM is how a server renders a component; the runtime kept the root but skipped its styles, and could not see a closed one. |
| `unadoptStylesheet()`, `HTMLModules.unload()`, `type` / `integrity` on `<html-export src>` | Counterparts: what can be adopted can be un-adopted, what can be loaded can be evicted, and a re-export can be typed like an import. Custom elements remain impossible to undefine. |

## Extension beyond the PRD: data binding

The PRD's templates are static. `{{attribute}}` in a template's text and attribute values, and `props="name count:number"`
on an export, are an extension designed to stay declarative: a binding is only an attribute name (no expressions,
no `eval`), text is never parsed as markup, URL attributes refuse script URLs, `on*` / `style` / `srcdoc` are never
bound, and an update patches only the bound nodes. No loops, conditionals or two-way binding, deliberately: they
would need an expression language. See [HTML syntax](/html-modules/api/html-syntax/#data-binding-in-templates).

## Extension beyond the PRD: form-associated components

`form-associated` (and `form-control="selector"`) on an export: the registered class is `static formAssociated` with
`ElementInternals`, supplying a form value (a control in the template, or `el.value`), validity, disabled, reset and
restore. `attachInternals()` is memoized so the closed-declarative-root lookup and subclasses share the one call the
platform allows. Enter in a `form-control` `<input>` does implicit submission (the default button, a disabled one blocking it),
and `form-role="submit"|"reset"` makes a component a submit or reset button: the platform has no custom-element submit
button (`requestSubmit(el)` throws), so the library fires `submit` with `submitter` itself. See [HTML syntax](/html-modules/api/html-syntax/#form-associated-components).

## Extension beyond the PRD: dev server, hot reload and Vite

`html-module dev [dir]` serves and watches a directory and hot reloads open pages; `HTMLModules.hotReload()` swaps a
re-fetched module's components and styles under live elements (registered classes delegate to a swappable definition,
because custom element definitions cannot be replaced); `@johnhenry/html-modules/vite` compiles HTML modules imported
from JavaScript and gives them the same HMR. These are development tools: the dev server is not a bundler or a custom
module loader (the PRD's non-goals), only a static server with a change feed. See
[Dev server, hot reload and Vite](/html-modules/api/dev/).

## Extension beyond the PRD: scoped custom element registries

`registry="scoped"` on a module's import (or `<html-import-settings>`): its tags are registered in a per-component-definition
`CustomElementRegistry` that the component's shadow roots are created with, so two versions of a library that share inner tag
names coexist. Feature-detected (`supportsScopedRegistries()`), with a warned fallback to the global registry; page-level
use is rejected because a page's tags live in the document's registry. See [HTML syntax](/html-modules/api/html-syntax/#scoped-registries).

## Extension beyond the PRD: an opt-in template sanitizer

The PRD's trust model is "a module URL is as trusted as a `<script src>`", which leaves no way to take markup-only
components from a less-trusted origin (issue #3). `sanitize` is a **hook, not a sanitizer**: a function every component
template passes through at load time (`createHTMLModules({ sanitize })`, `import(src, { sanitize })`, `<html-import>.sanitize`;
sync or async; returns a string, `TrustedHTML` or a `DocumentFragment` that is stamped without being parsed again). It runs
in the loader, after the record is read and before definitions exist, because the runtime's `viewOf()` is synchronous and
a custom element definition cannot wait; it never sees module source (so `<html-export>` and `<html-import>` survive), a
sanitized module sanitizes what it imports and **cannot import JavaScript**, and a module is cached per sanitizer.
`@johnhenry/html-modules/safe-fragment` adapts `@johnhenry/safe-fragment` (an optional peer, not a dependency) and
derives a profile from safe-fragment's `component-template-v1` with `ui--*` custom elements; templates keep their ids
(`idPolicy: "keep-in-shadow"`, because every template is stamped into a shadow root). Deliberately not done: a `sanitize`
attribute or `<html-import-settings>` entry (a function is not a setting; the compiler and scanner would have to agree on it),
sanitizing stylesheets (`<style>` is a non-goal in safe-fragment, ADR 0006; a module's own `<html-export><style>` is outside
what the hook sees) or compiled output, and bundling a sanitizer. See [Sanitizing templates](/html-modules/api/sanitize/).

## Extension beyond the PRD: TypeScript declarations

Declarations for every entry point, generated from JSDoc (`tsc --declaration --allowJs --emitDeclarationOnly`) and checked
by compiling a typed consumer in strict mode. See [TypeScript](/html-modules/api/#typescript).

## Deferred

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **HTML Include** (§7, optional sixth concept; `<html-include src="./layout.html#header">`) | The PRD marks it optional and "may later be provided"; it composes DOM rather than defining components, and deserves its own design pass (slot projection, re-rendering, fragments). |
| **Further export metadata** (§9.3: registration behaviour, version, hydration hints, lifecycle modules) | §9.3 forbids adding metadata before it has concrete semantics. |
| **Compiler `--format bundle`** (conversation §7) | Mentioned as a possibility; a bundle needs a dependency walk over the file system and adds nothing to semantics. Dependencies compile file by file today (the CLI accepts several inputs). |
| **Rewriting relative URLs in templates** | A template is stamped into the page, so `<img src="./x.png">` resolves against the page, not the module. A correct rewrite is an HTML-aware pass over every URL-bearing attribute (`src`, `href`, `srcset`, `poster`, `<use href>`, inline `style`), and it would break URLs meant for the page. Documented instead; a module's `<style>` already resolves against the module (`baseURL`). |
| **Hybrid script semantics** (a `<script>` inside an export that supplies the class) | The conversation explicitly leaves it out of V1. JS behaviour attaches by extending a definition's `.element` in a JS module instead. |
