[aimatey](/aimatey/) middleware for code-based tool execution via the [andbox](/andbox/) sandbox.

LLMs that don't support native tool calling can still use tools by writing code. This middleware intercepts LLM responses, extracts fenced code blocks, adapts common Python-isms to JavaScript, and executes them in a sandboxed environment with tool stubs injected as callable functions.

## Install

```bash
npm install @johnhenry/aimatey-middleware-andbox
```

**Peer dependency:** this package requires `andbox` to be installed separately:

```bash
npm install andbox
```

## Usage

andbox only accepts `capabilities` (the functions reachable from sandboxed code via `host.call(name, ...)`) at `createSandbox({ capabilities })` time — there is no way to attach them later. So this middleware needs *either* the andbox `createSandbox` factory itself (and it will create the sandbox for you, wired to your tools), *or* an already-built sandbox that you created with the capabilities already set. The factory form is recommended:

```js
import { createCodeExecutionMiddleware } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-middleware-andbox';
import { createSandbox } from 'andbox';

const tools = [
  { name: 'fetch_data', description: 'Fetch data from a URL', parameters: { url: { type: 'string' } } },
  { name: 'save_file', description: 'Save content to a file', parameters: { path: { type: 'string' }, content: { type: 'string' } } },
];

const middleware = createCodeExecutionMiddleware({
  createSandbox,       // andbox's factory -- the middleware calls this itself
  tools,
  executeToolFn: async (name, params) => {
    // Route to your actual tool implementations
    console.log(`Executing tool: ${name}`, params);
    return { success: true, output: 'done' };
  },
  maxResultLength: 4096,
  timeoutMs: 30000,
});

// Use with aimatey
// bridge.use(middleware);
```

If you need full control over the sandbox (custom `importMap`, `policy`, `onConsole`, etc.), build it yourself with `toolsToCapabilities()` and pass the instance as `sandbox` instead — the middleware will use it as-is and will **not** be able to add capabilities to it later:

```js
import { createCodeExecutionMiddleware, toolsToCapabilities } from '@johnhenry/aimatey-middleware-andbox';
import { createSandbox } from 'andbox';

const executeToolFn = async (name, params) => ({ success: true });
const sandbox = await createSandbox({
  capabilities: toolsToCapabilities(tools, executeToolFn),
  policy: { limits: { maxCalls: 50 } },
});

const middleware = createCodeExecutionMiddleware({ sandbox, tools, executeToolFn });
```

## API

### `createCodeExecutionMiddleware(options)`

Creates an aimatey middleware object with an `after` hook.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `createSandbox` | `(opts) => Sandbox \| Promise<Sandbox>` | one of `createSandbox`/`sandbox` required | andbox's `createSandbox` factory. The middleware creates (and caches) the sandbox itself, with capabilities wired from `tools`/`executeToolFn`. |
| `sandbox` | `Sandbox` | one of `createSandbox`/`sandbox` required | A pre-built andbox sandbox instance. Must already have been created with `capabilities: toolsToCapabilities(tools, executeToolFn)` — capabilities cannot be added after creation. |
| `sandboxOptions` | `object` | `{}` | Extra options merged into `createSandbox()` when using the `createSandbox` factory (e.g. `importMap`, `policy`, `onConsole`). Any `capabilities` here are merged with (and can override) the tool-derived ones. |
| `tools` | `Array<{name, description?, parameters?}>` | *required* | Tool definitions |
| `executeToolFn` | `(name, params) => Promise<any>` | *required* | Function to execute tools |
| `maxResultLength` | `number` | `4096` | Max characters per result |
| `codeLanguages` | `string[]` | `['js','javascript','tool_code','python','py','']` | Languages to execute |
| `timeoutMs` | `number` | `30000` | Execution timeout in ms |

The middleware attaches the following properties to the response:

- `_codeResults` — array of `{code, output, error?}` for each executed block
- `_toolCalls` — synthetic tool call entries
- `_cleanText` — response text with code blocks stripped
- `_resultSummary` — formatted summary string

### Other exports

- `extractCodeBlocks(text)` — extract fenced code blocks from text, returns `Array<{lang, code}>`
- `stripCodeBlocks(text)` — remove all fenced code blocks from text
- `adaptPythonisms(code)` — convert Python patterns (`True`, `False`, `None`, f-strings) to JavaScript equivalents
- `autoAwait(code, asyncFnPatterns?)` — insert `await` before common async calls (`print()`, `browser_*()`, and custom patterns)
- `toolsToCapabilities(tools, executeToolFn)` — convert tool definitions to an object of callable async functions
- `toolsToPreamble(tools)` — generate JavaScript code that declares function stubs for each tool
- `formatResults(results, maxResultLength?)` — format execution results as a summary string
- `resultsToToolCalls(results)` — convert results to synthetic tool call entries

## Security model

This middleware routes LLM-authored code through andbox's Worker sandbox and gates which host functions (`tools`) that code can call via `host.call()`. **That capability gate is not a security boundary against adversarial LLM output.** andbox's own [Security model](/andbox/#security-model) documents confirmed ways sandboxed code can act outside what `capabilities` appears to allow — in short:

- Worker-global APIs (`fetch`, `WebSocket`, `Worker`, `importScripts`, `indexedDB`) are directly reachable from sandboxed code regardless of which `capabilities` you supplied — omitting a `fetch`-like tool does not block network access.
- The capability gate can be bypassed via the prototype chain (`host.call('constructor', ...)` resolves to the real global `Object` constructor).
- `sandboxImport()` will load and execute an arbitrary remote URL.
- A timeout stops message delivery to a killed Worker, not an in-flight host-side effect that capability call already triggered.

In other words: wiring `executeToolFn` into the sandbox (as this package does correctly) lets you *organize* which tools well-behaved LLM-generated code can call, and gives you timeouts/rate limits for code you already trust. It does **not** contain code that is deliberately trying to escape. If you're executing output from an untrusted or adversarial model, pair this middleware with OS-level isolation (a separate process/container with its own network and filesystem restrictions) in addition to andbox's Worker boundary — do not rely on the tool-capability gate alone.
