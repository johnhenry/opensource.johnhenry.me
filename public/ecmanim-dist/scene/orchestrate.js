 * animation elsewhere (e.g. a compositing tool) without a full render.
 *
 * construct() is a sequential script (a manim-style "do X for N seconds,
 * then do Y") -- there is no way to "jump into the middle" without
 * re-running everything up to that point, so this re-executes construct()
 * from scratch on every call. Each frame's play()/wait() work is cheap (no
 * real rendering happens before the cutoff), so this is fine for
 * scrubbing/previewing, but isn't meant for a hot per-video-frame render
 * loop -- pass `targetTime: Infinity` to run to completion once and read
 * the final `scene.time` as the scene's total duration.
