// F4 — parallel frame-range rendering (planning layer).
//
// The parallel unit here is the SEGMENT (each play()/wait() call), NOT the
// individual frame. Frame N inside a play() depends on the mobject state left
// by frames 0..N-1, so frames within one segment cannot be parallelized. But
// distinct play()/wait() segments each produce their own partial-movie-file
// (content-addressed by hash), so *whole segments* can be rendered on separate
// workers and concatenated afterwards — exactly the cache path node.ts already
// uses, just sharded.
//
// This module is the pure PLANNING layer: discover the ordered segment manifest
// and partition it across workers. It intentionally avoids worker_threads and
// other node-only heavy imports so it can be reasoned about (and unit-tested)
// on its own. The node-only orchestration lives in ../node-parallel.ts.
import { Scene } from "./Scene.js";

 * Run construct() purely to harvest the segment manifest. Every segment is
 * skipped (so no PNG is ever encoded) and the frameHandler is a no-op, but time
 * and frameCount still advance — so `scene.playRecords` comes out with correct,
 * deterministic frame ranges and content hashes. Cheap: no rendering happens.
 *
 * `makeScene` builds a fresh Scene (or Scene subclass instance / construct fn);
 * `sceneInput` is passed to a plain construct function form. `opts.camera` is
 * optional — most scenes don't touch the camera during construct(), but if the
 * scene needs one it may be supplied.
