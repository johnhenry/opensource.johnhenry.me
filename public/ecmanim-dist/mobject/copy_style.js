// Shared denylist-based memberwise style copy, extracted from
// Mobject.become() (previously the only place this existed, with its own
// doc comment literally calling it "the primitive behind always_redraw and
// transform-less morphs"). alwaysRedraw() (value_tracker.ts) and reactive()
// (reactive/signal.ts) each independently hardcoded their OWN allowlist of
// "common style fields" -- different subsets (alwaysRedraw's 7-property list
// was missing "radius", which reactive()'s 9-property list had) -- so a
// custom field on a user's Mobject subclass would silently fail to redraw
// depending on which of the three code paths built it. A denylist (copy
// everything except identity/structural fields) instead of an allowlist
// fixes this class of bug for any current or future subclass field.

 *  identity, already-explicitly-handled geometry, or animation/updater state
