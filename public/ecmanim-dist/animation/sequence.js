// F6 (Part A): Remotion-style `Sequence` time-shift.
//
// A `Sequence` wraps a SINGLE animation and shifts its "active" window inside a
// larger timeline, mirroring Remotion's `<Sequence from durationInFrames>`.
// Outside the window the child is frozen: before its `from` frame it sits at its
// start state (local alpha 0); after `from + durationInFrames` it sits at its end
// state (local alpha 1); inside the window it progresses 0 -> 1.
//
// Implementation strategy: extend the existing AnimationGroup machinery. The
// group already dispatches a *local* alpha to each child via its window
// (`(t - start)/span`, clamped to [0,1]). We create a single-child group whose
// child window is exactly [from, from+duration) expressed as a fraction of the
// total runTime. AnimationGroup's clamp then gives us the freeze-before /
// freeze-after behavior for free, and `squishRateFunc` is layered on the child's
// own rate function as a belt-and-suspenders windowing so the child reports its
// start value before the window and its end value after it, independent of how
// the outer alpha is driven.
