// Diagram diff (campaign 4, cluster M3 — "your diagram, evolving"): morph one
// rendered mermaid diagram into another. Elements are matched by FRIENDLY id
// (the stable cross-render key — the raw SVG ids carry per-render `mmdN`
// prefixes, so they never match between two loadMermaid calls):
//
//   shared friendly id in both     Transform old part -> new part (in place)
//   only in the old diagram        FadeOut
//   only in the new diagram        FadeIn
//   un-id'd remainder (grids,      crossfade (simultaneous FadeOut old rest /
//   backgrounds, loose labels)     FadeIn new rest)
//
// MATCHING APPROACH — buildMatchingFromKeyed (transform_matching.ts) fed
// friendly-id-keyed part VGroups directly, NOT TransformMatchingAuto with
// seeded matchIds. Rationale: SVGMobject (hence DiagramMobject) is FLAT — its
// submobjects are the individual drawable leaves, so piecesOf(diagram) yields
// hundreds of anonymous VMobjects, and TransformMatchingAuto's autoKey
// (matchId -> text -> shape signature) would compare leaf-by-leaf with no way
// to see the friendly-id grouping (seeding matchId on byId(...) wrapper
// VGroups doesn't help: those wrappers aren't in the diagram's tree, so
// piecesOf never visits them). Keying byId() wrappers through
// buildMatchingFromKeyed gives exactly the same Transform/FadeOut/FadeIn
// composition TransformMatchingAuto would build, minus the key-derivation
// layer we'd be fighting.
//
// Scene cleanup follows matchTex's proven introduced/getMobjectsToRemove
// override (src/mobject/mathtex.ts): at finish, the old diagram AND every
// loose wrapper the child animations introduced leave the scene, and
// `newDiagram` itself is added — its matched parts coincide with the
// transformed old geometry at alpha 1, so the swap is invisible and the scene
// ends holding exactly `newDiagram`.
