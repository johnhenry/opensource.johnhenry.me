// F6 (Part B): mobject-level transition catalogue.
//
// A transition moves the scene from an OUTGOING mobject `a` to an INCOMING
// mobject `b`. The design goal is to keep TIMING orthogonal to PRESENTATION:
//
//   - PRESENTATION = which primitive animations run and in which visual style
//     (fade? slide? directional wipe?). This is what distinguishes crossFade
//     from slide from wipe.
//   - TIMING = when each side's window opens/closes, its total runTime, and its
//     easing. This is expressed uniformly through `runTime`, `rateFunc`, and
//     `overlap`, and is applied identically regardless of the presentation.
//
// Concretely: every transition builds the SAME kind of AnimationGroup, and the
// only timing knob is `overlap`, which is turned into a pair of sub-windows via
// `squishRateFunc` (outgoing plays in the early part, incoming in the late part,
// with `overlap` controlling how much they share). Swapping the presentation
// (fade vs slide) never touches the windowing code below.
//
// Names deliberately avoid the existing `Swap` class in transform_extra.ts.
